      <summary>This namespace contains APIs in the Microsoft Store Services SDK that you can use in conjunction with features in the Windows Dev Center dashboard to engage with your customers. These features include running app experiments with A/B testing, launching Feedback Hub from your app so that users can submit feedback that you can respond to in the dashboard, logging custom events from your app that you can review in the dashboard, and sending targeted push notifications from the dashboard to your app.</summary>
